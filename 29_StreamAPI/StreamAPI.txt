*******************************************************************************************************

In layman terms, the Stream API in Java is like a conveyor belt in a factory that processes a collection of items step by step. Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to filter out the even numbers, double them, and then sum them up. The Stream API allows you to do this in a clear and concise way by chaining together a series of operations.


Stream: A sequence of elements that supports various methods to perform computations on those elements.

Functional Programming: The Stream API encourages a functional programming style, where you can use lambda expressions and method references.

Intermediate Operations: Operations that transform a stream into another stream, such as filter, map, and sorted. These operations are lazy and do not execute until a terminal operation is called.

Terminal Operations: Operations that produce a result or a side-effect, such as forEach, reduce, and collect. These operations trigger the execution of the intermediate operations.

Benefits of Using Stream API :-

Concise Code: Reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for common operations on collections.

Readability: Makes the code more readable and easier to understand by chaining operations together.

Parallel Processing: Streams can be easily parallelized to improve performance on multi-core processors.


Common Use Cases :-

Filtering: Removing elements that do not match a given condition.

Mapping: Transforming elements into another form.

Reducing: Combining elements into a single result.

Collecting: Gathering elements into a collection, such as a list or a set.

1. What is the Stream API in Java?
Answer: The Stream API in Java is a powerful tool for processing sequences of elements in a functional programming style. It provides methods for filtering, mapping, and reducing collections of data.


2. What are the main components of the Stream API?
Answer: The main components of the Stream API are streams, intermediate operations, and terminal operations. Streams represent sequences of elements, intermediate operations transform streams, and terminal operations produce results or side-effects.


3. What is the difference between intermediate and terminal operations in the Stream API?
Answer: Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream and are lazy, meaning they do not execute until a terminal operation is called. Terminal operations produce a result or a side-effect and trigger the execution of the intermediate operations.


4. Provide an example of using the Stream API to filter, map, and reduce a list of numbers.
Answer:
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 7, 3, 2, 6);
int result = nums.stream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .map(n -> n * 2)
                 .reduce(0, (c, e) -> c + e);
System.out.println(result); // Output: 24


5. What is the purpose of the filter method in the Stream API?
Answer: The filter method is an intermediate operation that returns a stream consisting of elements that match a given predicate. It is used to remove elements that do not satisfy the condition.


6. What is the purpose of the map method in the Stream API?
Answer: The map method is an intermediate operation that returns a stream consisting of the results of applying a given function to the elements of the stream. It is used to transform elements into another form.


7. What is the purpose of the reduce method in the Stream API?
Answer: The reduce method is a terminal operation that combines the elements of a stream into a single result using a given binary operator. It is used to perform aggregation operations, such as summing or averaging.


8. How can you parallelize a stream in Java?
Answer: You can parallelize a stream in Java by calling the parallelStream() method on a collection or the parallel() method on an existing stream. For example:
int result = nums.parallelStream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .map(n -> n * 2)
                 .reduce(0, (c, e) -> c + e);


9. What are the benefits of using the Stream API?
Answer: The benefits of using the Stream API include concise code, improved readability, and the ability to easily parallelize operations for better performance on multi-core processors.


10. Can you modify the elements of a collection using the Stream API?
Answer: No, the Stream API is designed for processing and transforming data, not for modifying the underlying collection. Streams are intended to be used in a functional programming style, where data is transformed and new collections are created rather than modifying existing ones.
