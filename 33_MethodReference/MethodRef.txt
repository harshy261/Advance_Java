*******************************************************************************************************


In layman terms, a method reference in Java is like a shortcut that allows you to refer to a method without actually calling it. Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to print each number. Instead of writing a lambda expression to call the System.out.println method, you can use a method reference to make your code shorter and more readable.


Method Reference: A shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method.

Types of Method References: There are four types of method references in Java:

Reference to a Static Method: ClassName::staticMethodName

Reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object: instance::instanceMethodName

Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type: ClassName::instanceMethodName

Reference to a Constructor: ClassName::new

Benefits of Using Method References :- 

Concise Code: Reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for lambda expressions.

Readability: Makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

Reusability: Allows you to reuse existing methods without writing new lambda expressions.


Common Use Cases :-

Printing Elements: Using method references to print elements of a collection.

Transforming Elements: Using method references to transform elements of a collection.

Creating Objects: Using constructor references to create new objects.

1. What is a method reference in Java?
Answer: A method reference in Java is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. It allows you to refer to a method without actually calling it, making the code more concise and readable.


2. What are the types of method references in Java?
Answer: The types of method references in Java are:
Reference to a static method: ClassName::staticMethodName
Reference to an instance method of a particular object: instance::instanceMethodName
Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type: ClassName::instanceMethodName
Reference to a constructor: ClassName::new


3. Provide an example of a method reference to a static method.
Answer:
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 7, 3, 2, 6);
nums.forEach(MethodReferenceExample::printNumber);

public static void printNumber(Integer number) {
    System.out.println(number);
}


4. Provide an example of a method reference to an instance method of a particular object.
Answer:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.forEach(System.out::println);


5. Provide an example of a method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type.
Answer:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println);


6. Provide an example of a method reference to a constructor.
Answer:
Supplier<MethodReferenceExample> supplier = MethodReferenceExample::new;
MethodReferenceExample example = supplier.get();
example.printMessage();

public MethodReferenceExample() {
    System.out.println("Constructor called");
}

public void printMessage() {
    System.out.println("Hello from MethodReferenceExample");
}


7. What are the benefits of using method references?
Answer: The benefits of using method references include concise code, improved readability, and the ability to reuse existing methods without writing new lambda expressions.


8. When should you use method references over lambda expressions?
Answer: You should use method references over lambda expressions when the method reference makes the code more concise and readable, and when you can directly refer to an existing method without needing additional logic.


9. Can method references be used with functional interfaces?
Answer: Yes, method references can be used with functional interfaces. They provide a way to implement the single abstract method of a functional interface using an existing method.


10. What is the difference between a method reference and a lambda expression?
Answer: A method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression that refers to an existing method, making the code more concise and readable. A lambda expression is an anonymous function that can contain more complex logic and is written inline.
