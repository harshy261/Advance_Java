Explanation of Lambda Expressions in Java
In layman terms, a lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an instance of a functional interface. It allows you to write a method implementation in a more compact and readable form. Lambda expressions are particularly useful for simplifying the code when working with functional interfaces, such as those used in collections and streams.

Key Points
Functional Interface: A lambda expression can only be used with a functional interface, which is an interface with exactly one abstract method.
Syntax: The basic syntax of a lambda expression is (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }.
Type Inference: The compiler can often infer the types of the parameters, so you don't need to specify them explicitly.
Simplified Code: Lambda expressions make the code more concise and readable, especially when dealing with simple method implementations.




Interview Questions and Answers
What is a lambda expression in Java?

Answer: A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an instance of a functional interface. It allows you to write a method implementation in a more compact and readable form.
What is the syntax of a lambda expression?

Answer: The basic syntax of a lambda expression is (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }. For example:
(int i) -> System.out.println("in show " + i);



What is a functional interface, and why is it important for lambda expressions?

Answer: A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. Lambda expressions can only be used with functional interfaces because they provide the target type for the lambda expression.
Can lambda expressions have multiple parameters?

Answer: Yes, lambda expressions can have multiple parameters. For example:
(int i, int j) -> System.out.println("in show " + i + " and " + j);


What is type inference in the context of lambda expressions?

Answer: Type inference means that the compiler can often infer the types of the parameters in a lambda expression, so you don't need to specify them explicitly. For example:
A obj = i -> System.out.println("in show " + i);


Provide an example of a lambda expression with a functional interface.

Answer:
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
    }
}



What are the benefits of using lambda expressions?

Answer: The benefits of using lambda expressions include:
More concise and readable code
Simplified syntax for implementing functional interfaces
Improved productivity and reduced boilerplate code
Can lambda expressions capture variables from the enclosing scope?

Answer: Yes, lambda expressions can capture variables from the enclosing scope, similar to anonymous inner classes. These variables must be effectively final, meaning they cannot be modified after being assigned.
