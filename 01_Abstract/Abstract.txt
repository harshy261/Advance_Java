Explanation of the abstract Keyword in Java
In Java, the abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes and abstract methods. Here's a simple explanation:

Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is meant to be subclassed, and it can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).
Abstract Method: An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide implementations for these methods.






Interview Questions and Answers
What is an abstract class in Java?

Answer: An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
What is an abstract method in Java?

Answer: An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class must provide implementations for these methods.
Can an abstract class have a constructor?

Answer: Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor. However, it cannot be used to instantiate the abstract class directly. The constructor can be called when a subclass is instantiated.
Can an abstract class have static methods?

Answer: Yes, an abstract class can have static methods. These methods belong to the class itself and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
Can an abstract class be final?

Answer: No, an abstract class cannot be declared as final. A final class cannot be subclassed, which contradicts the purpose of an abstract class.
Can an abstract class implement an interface?

Answer: Yes, an abstract class can implement an interface. It can provide implementations for some or all of the methods in the interface. If it does not provide implementations for all methods, the subclass must implement the remaining methods.
What happens if a subclass does not implement all abstract methods of its superclass?

Answer: If a subclass does not implement all abstract methods of its abstract superclass, the subclass itself must be declared as abstract.
