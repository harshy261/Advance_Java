*******************************************************************************************************

In layman terms, collections in Java are like containers that can hold multiple items. Imagine you have a box where you can store different objects like toys, books, or clothes. Similarly, in programming, collections are used to store and manage groups of objects. The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to make it easier to work with collections of objects.


Collection API: A set of classes and interfaces that provide a standard way to handle groups of objects.

Collection Interface: The root interface in the collection hierarchy. It represents a group of objects known as elements.

Collections Class: A utility class that provides static methods for operating on collections, such as sorting and searching.

Types of Collections :-

List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Examples include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Examples include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Queue: A collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Examples include LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

Map: A collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed. Examples include HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

Interview Questions and Answers :-

1. What is the Java Collections Framework?
Answer: The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provide a standard way to handle groups of objects. It includes interfaces like List, Set, Queue, and Map, and classes like ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, and HashMap.


2. What is the difference between Collection and Collections in Java?
Answer: Collection is an interface that represents a group of objects, while Collections is a utility class that provides static methods for operating on collections, such as sorting and searching.


3. What are the main interfaces of the Java Collections Framework?
Answer: The main interfaces of the Java Collections Framework are List, Set, Queue, and Map.


4. What is the difference between List and Set in Java?
Answer: A List is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements, while a Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.


5. Provide an example of how to sort a list using the Collections Framework.
Answer:
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(3);
numbers.add(8);
numbers.add(1);
Collections.sort(numbers);
System.out.println("Sorted List: " + numbers);


6. What is a Map in Java, and how is it different from other collections?
Answer: A Map is a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed. It is different from other collections because it stores key-value pairs rather than individual elements.


7. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Answer: ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface, providing fast random access to elements. LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface, providing fast insertion and deletion of elements.


8. How do you synchronize a collection in Java?
Answer: You can synchronize a collection using the Collections.synchronizedList(), Collections.synchronizedSet(), or Collections.synchronizedMap() methods. For example:
List<Integer> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());


9. What is the purpose of the Iterator interface in the Collections Framework?
Answer: The Iterator interface provides a way to traverse the elements of a collection sequentially. It allows you to remove elements from the collection during the iteration.


10. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Answer: HashMap is an unordered collection that provides constant-time performance for basic operations like get and put. TreeMap is a sorted map that maintains its elements in ascending order based on the natural ordering of its keys or a custom comparator.
