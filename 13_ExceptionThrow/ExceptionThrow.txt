In layman terms, the throw keyword in Java is used to manually trigger an exception. Think of it as a way to signal that something has gone wrong in your code, and you want to handle it in a specific way. When you use the throw keyword, you create an exception object and "throw" it, which means you are telling the program that an error has occurred.


Manually Triggering Exceptions: The throw keyword is used to manually trigger an exception.

Creating Exception Objects: You create an exception object using the new keyword and then throw it.

Handling Thrown Exceptions: Thrown exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks.


*******************************************************************************************************


Create an Exception Object: Use the new keyword to create an exception object.

Exception e = new Exception("Custom error message");

Throw the Exception: Use the throw keyword to throw the exception.
throw e;

Handle the Exception: Use a try-catch block to catch and handle the thrown exception.
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}


Benefits of Using the throw Keyword :
Custom Error Handling: Allows you to create custom error messages and handle specific conditions in your code.
Improved Code Readability: Makes it clear where and why an error is being triggered.
Separation of Concerns: Separates the error detection logic from the error handling logic, making the code easier to maintain.
