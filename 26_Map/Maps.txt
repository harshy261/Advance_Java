Explanation of Maps in Java
In layman terms, a Map in Java is like a dictionary that stores key-value pairs. Imagine you have a dictionary where you can look up a word (the key) and find its definition (the value). Similarly, in programming, a Map allows you to store and retrieve data using unique keys. Each key maps to a specific value, and you can use the key to quickly find the corresponding value.

Key Points
Key-Value Pairs: A Map stores data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.
No Duplicate Keys: A Map does not allow duplicate keys. If you try to add a key that already exists, the old value will be replaced with the new value.
Common Implementations: The most common implementations of the Map interface are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.








Types of Maps
HashMap:

Description: Uses a hash table for storage. It does not guarantee any specific order of elements.
Example:
Map<String, Integer> students = new HashMap<>();
students.put("Navin", 56);
students.put("Harsh", 23);
students.put("Sushil", 67);
students.put("Kiran", 92);
students.put("Harsh", 45); // Replaces the old value for key "Harsh"




LinkedHashMap:

Description: Maintains a linked list of the entries in the map, in the order in which they were inserted.
Example:
Map<String, Integer> students = new LinkedHashMap<>();
students.put("Navin", 56);
students.put("Harsh", 23);
students.put("Sushil", 67);
students.put("Kiran", 92);
students.put("Harsh", 45); // Replaces the old value for key "Harsh"




TreeMap:

Description: Stores elements in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom comparator.
Example:
Map<String, Integer> students = new TreeMap<>();
students.put("Navin", 56);
students.put("Harsh", 23);
students.put("Sushil", 67);
students.put("Kiran", 92);
students.put("Harsh", 45); // Replaces the old value for key "Harsh"











Interview Questions and Answers
What is a Map in Java?

Answer: A Map in Java is a collection that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. It allows you to store and retrieve data using keys.
What are the common implementations of the Map interface?

Answer: The common implementations of the Map interface are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.
What is the difference between a HashMap and a TreeMap?

Answer: A HashMap does not guarantee any specific order of elements, while a TreeMap stores elements in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom comparator.
How do you add key-value pairs to a Map in Java?

Answer: You add key-value pairs to a Map using the put method. For example:
Map<String, Integer> students = new HashMap<>();
students.put("Navin", 56);
students.put("Harsh", 23);







What happens if you try to add a duplicate key to a Map?

Answer: If you try to add a duplicate key to a Map, the old value associated with the key will be replaced with the new value.
How do you retrieve a value from a Map using a key?

Answer: You retrieve a value from a Map using the get method and passing the key as an argument. For example:
int value = students.get("Navin");





How do you check if a key exists in a Map?

Answer: You check if a key exists in a Map using the containsKey method. For example:
boolean exists = students.containsKey("Navin");




How do you iterate over the key-value pairs in a Map?

Answer: You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a Map using a for-each loop. For example:
for (String key : students.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(key + ": " + students.get(key));
}




What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?

Answer: HashMap is not synchronized and allows null keys and values, while Hashtable is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values.
Is a Map synchronized in Java?

Answer: No, a Map is not synchronized by default. If you need a synchronized Map, you can use Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());.
