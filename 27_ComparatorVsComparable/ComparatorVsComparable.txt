*******************************************************************************************************

In layman terms, Comparator and Comparable are two interfaces in Java that help you sort objects. Imagine you have a list of students, and you want to sort them by their age or name. Comparable allows you to define a natural ordering for the objects, like sorting students by age. Comparator allows you to define multiple ways to sort the objects, like sorting students by name or by age.


Comparable :-

Purpose: Defines a natural ordering for objects.

Interface: Comparable<T>

Method: compareTo(T o)

Usage: Implemented by the class whose objects need to be sorted.

Single Sorting Sequence: Only one sorting sequence can be defined.


Comparator :-

Purpose: Defines multiple ways to sort objects.

Interface: Comparator<T>

Method: compare(T o1, T o2)

Usage: Implemented by a separate class or anonymous class.

Multiple Sorting Sequences: Multiple sorting sequences can be defined.

Interview Questions and Answers
What is the Comparable interface in Java?

Answer: The Comparable interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of objects. It has a single method, compareTo(T o), which is used to compare the current object with another object of the same type.
What is the Comparator interface in Java?

Answer: The Comparator interface in Java is used to define multiple ways to compare and sort objects. It has a single method, compare(T o1, T o2), which is used to compare two objects of the same type.
What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?

Answer: Comparable is used to define the natural ordering of objects and is implemented by the class whose objects need to be sorted. Comparator is used to define multiple ways to compare and sort objects and is implemented by a separate class or anonymous class.
How do you sort a list of objects using Comparable?

Answer: To sort a list of objects using Comparable, the class must implement the Comparable interface and override the compareTo method. Then, you can use the Collections.sort method to sort the list. For example:
Collections.sort(students);






How do you sort a list of objects using Comparator?

Answer: To sort a list of objects using Comparator, you need to create a comparator class that implements the Comparator interface and override the compare method. Then, you can use the Collections.sort method with the comparator to sort the list. For example:Collections.sort(students, new AgeComparator());





Can you use both Comparable and Comparator in the same class?

Answer: Yes, you can use both Comparable and Comparator in the same class. The class can implement the Comparable interface to define the natural ordering, and you can create separate comparator classes to define additional sorting sequences.
Provide an example of a custom comparator in Java.

Answer:
class NameComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return s1.name.compareTo(s2.name);
    }
}




What is the purpose of the compareTo method in the Comparable interface?

Answer: The compareTo method in the Comparable interface is used to compare the current object with another object of the same type. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the current object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object, respectively.
What is the purpose of the compare method in the Comparator interface?

Answer: The compare method in the Comparator interface is used to compare two objects of the same type. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the first object is less than, equal to, or greater than the second object, respectively.
When would you use Comparator over Comparable?

Answer: You would use Comparator over Comparable when you need to define multiple ways to compare and sort objects, or when you cannot modify the class whose objects need to be sorted.
