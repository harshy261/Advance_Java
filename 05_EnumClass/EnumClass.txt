*******************************************************************************************************

In layman terms, an enum class in Java is a special type of class that represents a group of constants, but with added functionality. Unlike regular enums, which are just a list of constants, an enum class can have fields, methods, and constructors. This allows you to associate additional data and behavior with each constant.


Enum Declaration: Use the enum keyword to declare an enum class.

Fields and Methods: Enum classes can have fields and methods, just like regular classes.

Constructors: Enum classes can have constructors to initialize the fields for each constant.

Usage: Enum classes are useful when you need to associate additional data or behavior with each constant.

1. What is an enum class in Java?
Answer: An enum class in Java is a special type of class that represents a group of constants with added functionality. It can have fields, methods, and constructors, allowing you to associate additional data and behavior with each constant.


2. How do you declare an enum class in Java?
Answer: An enum class is declared using the enum keyword. For example:
enum Laptop {
    Macbook, XPS, Surface, ThinkPad;
}


3. Can an enum class have fields and methods?
Answer: Yes, an enum class can have fields and methods, just like a regular class. This allows you to associate additional data and behavior with each constant.


4. Can an enum class have a constructor?
Answer: Yes, an enum class can have a constructor. The constructor is used to initialize the fields for each constant. Enum constructors are always private or package-private.


5. Provide an example of an enum class with fields and methods.
Answer:
enum Laptop {
    Macbook(2000), XPS(1800), Surface(1500), ThinkPad(1200);

    private int price;

    // Constructor
    Laptop(int price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    // Getter method
    public int getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}


6. How do you iterate over all constants of an enum class?
Answer: You can use the values() method to get an array of all constants and iterate over them using a for-each loop. For example:
for (Laptop lap : Laptop.values()) {
    System.out.println(lap + " : " + lap.getPrice());
}


7. Can you override methods in an enum class?
Answer: Yes, you can override methods in an enum class. Each enum constant can have its own implementation of a method.


8. What is the purpose of the name() method in an enum class?
Answer: The name() method returns the name of the enum constant as a string. It is useful for getting the string representation of the constant.
