In layman terms, thread priority in Java is like assigning importance levels to different tasks. Imagine you have multiple tasks to complete, but some tasks are more urgent than others. By assigning higher priority to the urgent tasks, you ensure that they get more attention and are completed sooner. In programming, thread priority works similarly by allowing you to suggest which threads (tasks) should be given more CPU time compared to others.


Thread Priority: A way to suggest the importance of a thread relative to other threads.

Priority Levels: Java provides priority levels from 1 (lowest priority) to 10 (highest priority), with a default priority of 5.

Scheduler: The thread scheduler uses these priorities to decide which thread to run next. However, thread priority is just a suggestion, and the actual behavior depends on the underlying operating system's thread scheduling policy.

Benefits of Using Thread Priority :-

Control Over Execution: By setting thread priorities, you can suggest which threads should be given more CPU time, allowing you to control the execution order of tasks.

Efficient Resource Utilization: Higher priority threads can be given more CPU time, ensuring that critical tasks are completed sooner.


Important Points to Remember :-

Priority Range: Thread priorities range from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), with a default priority of 5.

Scheduler Behavior: Thread priority is just a suggestion to the thread scheduler. The actual behavior depends on the underlying operating system's thread scheduling policy.

Fairness: Setting thread priorities should be done carefully to ensure fairness and avoid starvation of lower priority threads.


Common Use Cases :-

Real-Time Systems: In real-time systems, certain tasks may need to be completed within a specific time frame, so they are given higher priority.

Background Tasks: Non-critical background tasks can be given lower priority to ensure that critical tasks get more CPU time.
